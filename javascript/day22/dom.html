    <h2>Creation & Development</h2>
    <p id="description">
        The first arc ran through (vol. 2) #1–6 and featured a new teenaged heroine, Araña. The second arc, in (vol. 2)
        #7–12, published after a short hiatus, featured a revamped, female version of the supervillain the Scorpion. A
        back-up feature in (vol. 2) #10–12 (Sept.-Nov. 2005) starred the character Nina Price, the Vampire by Night,[12]
        and (vol. 2) #13–14 (both Dec. 2005) led with the modern-West feature "Vegas", backed up by "Captain Universe".
        In an attempt to replicate history, Marvel announced that the new issue #15 would introduce a new generation of
        heroes in a 48-page standalone issue, in the hopes that they would become as popular as Spider-Man.</p>
